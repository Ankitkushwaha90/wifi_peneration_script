Creating a script for learning purposes related to Wi-Fi penetration testing can be a great way to understand networking, security, and scripting. However, it's important to note that penetration testing should only be performed on networks you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal and unethical.

Below is a simple Bash script that demonstrates some basic concepts related to networking and Wi-Fi. This script is for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly.

Bash Script: Basic Wi-Fi Network Scanner
This script will scan for available Wi-Fi networks using nmcli (NetworkManager command-line tool) and display the results.

bash
Copy
#!/bin/bash

# Title: Wi-Fi Network Scanner
# Description: A simple script to scan for available Wi-Fi networks.
# Author: Your Name
# Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Function to display the header
display_header() {
    echo "============================================="
    echo "Wi-Fi Network Scanner"
    echo "============================================="
    echo ""
}

# Function to scan for available Wi-Fi networks
scan_wifi_networks() {
    echo "Scanning for available Wi-Fi networks..."
    echo ""

    # Use nmcli to scan for Wi-Fi networks
    nmcli dev wifi

    echo ""
    echo "Scan complete."
}

# Function to display the footer
display_footer() {
    echo ""
    echo "============================================="
    echo "Scan completed on $(date)"
    echo "============================================="
}

# Main script execution
display_header
scan_wifi_networks
display_footer
How to Use the Script
Save the Script: Save the script to a file, e.g., wifi_scanner.sh.

Make the Script Executable: Run the following command to make the script executable:

bash
Copy
chmod +x wifi_scanner.sh
Run the Script: Execute the script by running:

bash
Copy
./wifi_scanner.sh
Explanation
nmcli dev wifi: This command lists all available Wi-Fi networks. It uses the nmcli tool, which is part of NetworkManager.

display_header and display_footer: These functions are used to format the output and make it more user-friendly.

scan_wifi_networks: This function performs the actual scan and displays the results.

Additional Learning Resources
Networking Basics: Understanding how networks work is crucial. Learn about IP addresses, subnets, routing, and protocols like TCP/IP.

Linux Command Line: Familiarize yourself with Linux commands, especially those related to networking (ifconfig, iwconfig, nmcli, etc.).

Security Tools: Learn about tools like aircrack-ng, wireshark, and nmap. These tools are commonly used in penetration testing.

Ethical Hacking: Consider taking an ethical hacking course to learn about penetration testing in a legal and ethical manner.

Scripting: Continue learning Bash scripting and other scripting languages like Python, which are often used in security-related tasks.

Important Note
This script is for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have permission before performing any kind of network scanning or penetration testing. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal and can result in severe consequences.

If you're interested in learning more about ethical hacking and penetration testing, consider pursuing certifications like CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) or OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional). These certifications provide structured learning paths and hands-on experience in a legal and ethical framework.
